## Ibrahim Chowdhury
To my core I DESPISE being bored and at the time my current career in retail was very repetitive and mundane. I've always had an interest for programming so combining the career aspect with that allows me to thrive in a field that I can just immerse myself into! As a Makers Academy graduate of the november 2021 cohort my mind has been opened up to all these pathways in the world of software development. Minor challenge seeking addiction aside I also love helping people. Software development allows me to combine all my wants from a career into an attainable goal. Something I can look back on and be fond of and enjoyed!

## Work Experience

**Ernest and Young**

  For one week I shadowed a Tax partner, and her team, attending their meetings, looking at the issues faced by them and their daily working routine. This helped me learn how leading businesses are run and what E&Y specifically do for their clients and why clients believe their way of service is better than others.


## Skills:

#### Teamwork and leadership:
During our first group engineering project it was important not to get overwhelmed as this was an entirely new thing for all if not most of us. Making sure we started on the right foot in terms of organising our "figurative" base being our trello and dealing with any concerns was paramount. This is something I took onus of and made sure everyone understood that it is first a learning experience rather than a task to be completed. Making sure everyone was heard and we worked together is something I made sure stuck with our group. We learnt many things throughout the project and it was very good as a learning point for a window into the software development world. At times we did appear crestfallen due to our code not working but, again the emphasis on taking a step back and reassessing it for the next day and not to be all "doom and gloom" about it delivered by me (at least vocally, I'm sure several of my group felt the same, as Makers teaches you emotional intelligence too). Breakthrough came the next day and with our spirits lifted and the positive mindset maintained throughout the team, we made good progress. caring for the whole team in a somewhat intermittent leadership role whilst obviously not taking contrio as we are all equals in the group and I think kept us afloat in the project.

#### Determination
At Makers one of the key things drilled into you is the idea of self-impaired learning. You can only go so far with outside help, change has to start from within. To get onto the course I myself had to apply, I had to the interviews, learn code beforehand for several months. All of these things whilst with outside help can be easier are void If you don't put in the effort yourself. Hypothetically I could've been doing lots of interview prep with a friend but in the actual interview it's ME who needs to show up and deliver. I am beyond determined to step into the working world of software development, I've gotten this far and even during the course when problems arise it isn;t about going in one direction no stopping, that is naivety. being determined to succeed means taking a step back, assessing the problem and keeping the mindset that “you can get through this. This mental fortitude is something I harbour in spades. This exact example happened most prominently during one of the second group engineering projects, the makersbnb (AirBnB clone). My pair and I wanted the available airbnbs to display in a vertical format with all their required info, including new ones entered on the create a listing page. It would coitnosily only display our test data. We struggled for some hours on it. Endlessly trying no thought solutions with no real thought. Going for lunch and coming back refreshed but not with the same mindset of "I am coming back to an unfixable issue." Using our new cleanslate and following the stack of issues enabled us to find a solution which resulted in lots of loud cheering! Continuing on and not giving upas we were under some time pressure but simultaneously not brute forcing anything not thought over allowed us to succeed and learn from this. Every success that endured struggle only greater fills my determination to learn and succeed. It's enjoyable getting the smalll win on this path. 

#### Communication

The X-men is a great comic book series but to the best of my knowledge NO ONE can read minds!!! Always being open and honest in life and with my cohort or fellow students in my engineering projects allows them and I to keep learning  and becoming better developments. Anytime I had an issue or question, straight in the slack or trello it goes. Even vice-versa maintaining an open commutative work environment allowed us in all three group projects to make sure no one was feeling behind or lacking knowledge in anything we covered. I remember distinctly in the third and final engineering project, after organising ourselves and being introduced to React, we all did our own research on it for the following day to group it together. Anyone still feeling behind made it known, rather than powering onwards with the knowledge of those who understood React. Luckily one of the group members Inigo found a step by step guide to React which was genuinely so helpful. Being aware of our limitations and communicating them was best for us long term, for the remainder of the course and for ourselves as developers.Good communications skills are the key to this. Checking up on everyone using morning, lunchtime and end of day retros was super beneficial.

#### Self-reflection

As determined as I may be as spoken about above, I know what I am and am not capable of. Some things can be learnt of course, but knowing where I stand allows me to proper absorb and seek what I need to better myself in that aspect. During the early weeks of the course we started interacting with databases using postgres sql. On their own they were straightforward but once we started trying to interact with them to manipulate other things, it was confusing. Makers offers constant support  throughout it's alumni, coaches, mentors and your own cohort. Rather than bog down in long winded videos or oversimplified videos about this I reached out to a fellow cohort member and experimented with databases to full grasp them. I learn best by doing rather than watching, knowing that I did the smart thing as there is no shame in having wak areas, we're all students on the course and only  human too! My awareness allows me to grow constantly and not get lost (figuratively speaking)

## Interests

I love playing football and videogames. Things that allow me to keep in touch with amany friends. What currently has my attention is the games by FROMSOFT known as Dark Souls. To put it simply spending time with friends in any capacity, through any of my interests or just chilling. Game of thrones was ruined for us all.
