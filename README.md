## Ibrahim Chowdhury
To my core I DESPISE being bored and at the time my current career in retail was very repetitve and mundane. I've always had an interest for programming so combining the career aspect with that allows me to thrive in a field that I can just immerse myself into! As a Makers Academy graduate of the november 2021 cohort my mind has been opened up to all these pathways in the world of software development. Minor challenge seeking addiction aside I also love helping people. Software development allows me to combine all my wants from a career into an attainable goal. Something I can look back on and be fond of and enjoyed!

## Work Experience

**Ernest and Young**

  For one week I shadowed a Tax partner, and her team, attending their meetings, looking at the issues faced by them and their daily working routine. This helped me learn how leading businesses are run and what E&Y specifically do for their clients and why clients believe their way of service is better than others.

## Interests

I love playing football and videogames. Things that allow me to keep in touch with amany friends. What currently has my attention is the games by FROMSOFT known as Dark Souls. To put it simply spending time with friends in any capacity, through any of my interests or just chilling. Game of thrones was ruined for us all.
